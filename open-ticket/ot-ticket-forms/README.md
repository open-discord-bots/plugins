                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Notes
1. Each form must have a unique `id`.
2. The maximum number of dropdown or button options is 25.
3. Use meaningful and concise placeholders to guide users.
4. Keep required questions clear to ensure proper response handling.
5. A form does not have a question limit. But try to make it as shorter as you can so the user can answer in a short time.
6. You can add as many forms as you want.
7. The forms will be sent automatically when a user creates a ticket from which the option id is on the `autoSendOptionIds` field.
8. You can also send a form using the slash command `/form send <form> <channel>`. This command allows sending the form to a text channel or a thread.

By following this structure, you can create robust and flexible forms with the OT plugin.
